# Password_Generator
The Password Generator application is designed to create strong and customized passwords for users. A strong password is a combination of alphabet both uppercase and lowercase,digits and special symbols such as punctuation characters. Managing multiple accounts can be challenging, especially when each account requires a different strong password. This application simplifies the process for generating unique and strong password for each account. I used tkinter library for GUI(Graphical User Interface).It provides a user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to interact with the application. I used random library for generating random characters within the password. I ensured that the password contains an uppercase ,a lowercase, a digit and a special character.The remaining characters are chosen randomly from the character set which includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols,resulting in a strong password with the desired length specified by the user.
